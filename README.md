## Project Objective
*Music Genre and Composer Classification Using Deep Learning*  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains the midi files of compositions from well-known classical composers like Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart. 

## Approach
The specific algorithms and networks used were as follows: 


These algorithms and networks were implemented through Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 
 - ### Imports and Libraries
   * Numpy 
   * Pandas 
   * Matplotlib / Pyplot
   * Scipy Stats
   * Seaborn 
   * Sklearn


## Results
The proposed project aims to use deep learning techniques to accurately predict the composer of a given musical score. The project will be implemented using LSTM and CNN architectures and will involve data pre-processing, feature extraction, model building, training, and evaluation. The final model can be used by novice musicians, listeners, and music enthusiasts to identify the composer of a musical piece accurately.
